# Firebie the T-Rex Runner
This game is basically *PWA* based version of the **T-Rex Runner Game** - the game that you get to play on Google Chrome when your connection is not working.

## About Firebie
**Firebie** is a rare kind of *Tyrannosaurus Rex* that is pink (well, is that thing even pink?), and he loves to *run*.

# The team
We are, well, friends. And as usual we work in the **DDD** (Deadline Driven Development). We build stuffs (including this project) with ❤ and ♨.
